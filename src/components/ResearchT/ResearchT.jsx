        <p className="bg-gray-100 ssm:text-sm shadow-xl rounded-md mt-2 px-2">
          IDEEA aims to assess various scenarios for India's energy transition,
          focusing on achieving significant decarbonization and carbon
          neutrality.

          The project concentrates on reducing carbon emissions from electricity
          generation, emphasizing the adoption of sustainable solutions like
          wind and solar power, which have become increasingly cost-effective.
          To address the intermittency of these sources, IDEEA also examines
          alternative balancing measures such as hydro energy, energy storage,
          grid enhancements, backup capacity, and responsive demand.

        <p className="bg-gray-100 ssm:text-sm shadow-xl rounded-md mt-2 px-2">
          IDEEA is developing a specialized modeling framework tailored to
          India's renewable energy sector. This framework will facilitate the
          evaluation of scenarios featuring high levels of variable renewable
          energy sources (VERs), utilizing detailed temporal and spatial data.
